# Chess

This is a classic Player vs Player (PvP) chess game crafted in C++ using the Raylib library. My main motivation behind creating this project was to learn more about OOP concepts in C++. While making this game I learnt a lot about Classes, Objects. Differences between a shallow copy and a deep copy and a lot more.
